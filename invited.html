	<h3>ALTA Keynote</h3>
	<p><strong>Mark Johnson, Professor at Macquarie University</strong></p>
	<h5>Abstract</h5>
	<p>Computational linguistics is about 5 decades old (the Association for Computational Linguistics was formed in 1962), and in that time the field has undergone several "scientific revolutions".  In this talk I'll briefly describe these, and use them to discuss the tension between science and engineering, and the relationship between computational linguistics and neighboring disciplines such as linguistics and psychology.  Then I'll get out my crystal ball to make some guesses about what the next 50 years might hold for the field.</p>
	<h5>Bio</h5>
	<p>Mark Johnson is a Professor of Language Science (CORE) in the Department of Computing at Macquarie University. He was awarded a BSc (Hons) in 1979 from the University of Sydney, an MA in 1984 from the University of California, San Diego and a PhD in 1987 from Stanford University. He held a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT from 1987 until 1988, and has been a visiting researcher at the University of Stuttgart, the Xerox Research Centre in Grenoble, CSAIL at MIT and the Natural Language group at Microsoft Research. He has worked on a wide range of topics in computational linguistics, but his main research area is parsing and its applications to text and speech processing. He was President of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 2003, and was a professor from 1989 until 2009 in the Departments of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences and Computer Science at Brown University.</p>
	<h3>ADCS Keynote</h3>
	<p><strong>Doug Oard, Professor at University of Maryland</strong></p>

	<h3>ALTA-ADCS Panel: NLP and IR in the Wild</h3>
	<h5>Abstract</h5>
	<p>NLP and IR have come a long way recently. AI is popular again, machine learning has entered the popular vocabulary, and search has become truly ubiquitous, with mobile search now outstripping desktop search. Seventeen year olds can sell summarisation companies for millions of dollars, there are multiple dedicated natural language generation companies, and our phones both listen and talk to us. Where do we go from here?</p>
