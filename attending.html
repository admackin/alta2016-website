      <h3>Transport</h3>
	<p>Please note that if you opt to travel on pubilc transport, many services are now prepay only so you may be wise to buy a <a href="http://www.transportnsw.info/en/tickets/index.page?">MetroTen ticket or an Opal Card</a> beforehand from a newsagent or convenience store. Timetables are available at <a href="http://transportnsw.info/">TransportNSW</a>.</p>
	<h4>Parramatta City campus</h4>
	<h5>Train</h5>
	<p>Alight at Parramatta train station and walk 10 mins down Smith Street, or take the regular <a href="http://www.parracity.nsw.gov.au/live/my_home/parking__and__transport/free_shuttle_bus">free shuttle</a> that runs in a loop around the CBD.</p>
	<h5>Bus</h5>
	<p>Use red Metrobus (express) services along Victoria Road.</p>
	<h5>Ferry</h5>
	<p>It is possible to catch the rivercat west up Parramatta River from Circular Quay or points west. It is scenic but it is not a short trip. Alight at Parramatta Wharf, which is a 5 minute walk from the campus.</p>
	<h5>Car</h5>
	<p>Parking is very limited within the downtown Parramatta area (pay-and-display council parking lots). If you need to park near the City campus, in your conference bag you will find a discount parking voucher for Westfield - with valet option - which is located adjacent to Parramatta Train Station, 10 minutes walk from the City campus. The discount voucher reduces your parking charge to $12 for the day. For valet parking enter via Campbell St (this costs an additional $10). To use the discount voucher, go to a pre-pay machine before exiting. Feed your regular ticket into the machine; your undiscounted rate will come up. Feed your discount voucher in and your rate will be discounted and you can then pay it with card or cash.</p>
	<h4>Parramatta South campus</h4>
	<h5>Train</h5>
	<p>It is easiest to alight at Parramatta train station and take a bus.</p>
	<p> Alternatively take train from Central Station to Rydalmere Station (T1 Western Line) changing at Clyde Station (infrequent services). From Rydalmere Station, walk up the steps to Victoria Road, turn left (west) and walk 10 minutes into Parramatta South campus, entrance on left via Victoria Rd entrance. </p>
	<h5>Car</h5>
	<p>There is limited parking on Parramatta South campus, especially as building works will be underway on campus during the workshop. Park in a blue spot, and buy a pay-and-display ticket ($9). If no parking left at Parramatta South campus, you can drive over the little bridge over Victoria Road to Parramatta North campus and park in any yellow bay, and then walk 10 mins back to Parramatta South campus.</p>
