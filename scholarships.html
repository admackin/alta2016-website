<p>Due to the generous support of our sponsors, ALTA will be offering travel support for students to attend and present at ALTA 2015 in Parramatta.</p>

<h3>Types of Scholarships</h3>

<p>This year, we will be offering two types of scholarships and you should be clear in your application which scholarship you would like to be considered for.</p>

<p><strong>Travel + Accommodation</strong>: Funding to cover the costs of airfares to Sydney airport plus 3 nights' accommodation at <a href="http://www.mystudentvillage.com/au/uws-village/parramatta/">UWS Village (Parramatta campus)</a></p>
<p><strong>Accommodation Only</strong>: 3 nights' accommodation at <a href="http://www.mystudentvillage.com/au/uws-village/parramatta/">UWS Village (Parramatta campus)</a></p>

<p>Unsuccessful applicants for the Travel + Accommodation scholarship will automatically be considered for the Accommodation Only scholarship.</p>

<h3>How to Apply</h3>

<p>Students wishing to be considered for travel support must apply by email to the organisers (<a href="mailto:workshop@alta.asn.au">workshop@alta.asn.au</a>) by <strong>20 November</strong>. Preference will be given to students who will be presenting a paper at the workshop. However, <strong>we encourage all students who would like to attend to apply</strong> as we have the support to be generous with our awards.</p>

<p>Applications should include:
<ul>
<li>Your full name</li>
<li>The name of your research supervisor</li>
<li>Where you will be travelling from</li>
<li>Which scholarship you would like to be considered for</li>
<li>A brief outline addressing the selection criteria below (bullet points is fine)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Please also arrange for your supervisor to send a separate email acknowledging that you are indeed enrolled as a student, and that the statements you made in the application are correct.</p>


<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<p>Applications will be selected according to the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will you be presenting a paper at ALTA 2015?</li>
<li>What stage of your PhD candidature are you at?</li>
<li>Have you received ALTA Student Travel Support previously?</li>
<li>Is your university and/or supervisor unable to fund (or fully fund) your travel?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Small Print</h3>
<p>The organising committee reserves the right to make awards as they see fit, or to alter the amount of any awards.</p>

<p>Note that the award will be in the form of a reimbursement of expenses, not a cash award. The awardees will only receive money, up to the value of the award, after producing receipts for appropriate expenses, and completing any supplied forms.<p>
